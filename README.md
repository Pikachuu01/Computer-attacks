# Computer-attacks
detecting computer attacks using machine learning
During the project, the main methods of artificial intelligence that can be used to implement protection against network attacks were considered and analyzed. The analysis showed that the use of artificial intelligence methods can significantly increase the effectiveness of protection systems against network attacks, providing more accurate and rapid detection of anomalies in network traffic. This allows for a prompt response to threats and the prevention of possible negative consequences.
